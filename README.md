# Global Guesser
 Try to guess where on the map a location is based on its street view!

Welcome to my GlobalGuesser app.
   
   To play, start by entering your name and pressing begin.
   
   Then, you can see the image on the top with the map on the bottom.
   
   Tapping on a location on the map will place your guess.
  
  You can zoom in on the map.
   
   Tapping confirm location will zoom to show both your marker and the actual location.
  
  The distance between the actual location and your guess is then added to your total score.
   
   Your score is like golf; you want a lower score.
   
   At one point I tried to have a list of high scores, but I found a bug in SwiftUI
   
   Bugs:
   - Sometimes you have to press confirm location twice. Idk why
   - Sometimes the marker for "Your Guess" is the one for the right answer. Idk why
   - Sometimes the zoom will zoom in a bit too far and cut off the text, Ik why but couldn't fix it.
   
   Everything else should be good. Have fun.
